What laundry services are available,"Laundry services are available at the hospital, although family members are encouraged to launder patients' clothing. There are washers and dryers on the units for you and your family members to use"
Should I keep my own medications with me,All medications ordered by your physician are provided by Hospital and distributed by your nurse. Please speak with your nurse if you have any questions.
Will my personal physician care for me during my stay,You will be cared for by a physician employed by Hospital for Special Care who is available to see you frequently and coordinate your care with your Special Care Team. Your personal physician will receive reports on your condition and all the necessary information to continue your care following your discharge.
How often is mail delivered,"Mail is distributed daily, except Sunday. Email availability may be arranged through your team"
Will I have my own room,"Most rooms are semi-private. We do have a limited number of private rooms, but first priority must be given to those requiring a private room for isolation purposes or other medical or equipment needs. We make every attempt to honor wishes for private rooms, but one cannot be guaranteed for the duration of your hospitalization."
Will there be a telephone in my room,"Telephones are provided in all patient rooms except the Neurobehavioral Program (NBP), Pediatric Unit and Autism Inpatient Unit (AIU). Only local calls may be made from these phones. For other types of calls, please contact a member of your team. Special telephones for the hearing impaired are available. Other needs may be addressed with your case manager."
Will there be a television in my room,"Televisions are provided free-of-charge in all patient rooms except the in the NBP, Pediatrics and AIU."
Is there a chapel or religious services,"The Interdenominational Chapel is open 24 hours a day. Religious services are held on Sunday mornings, on holidays, and as otherwise appropriate. The hospital has a Spiritual Care program staffed by chaplains"
Can I go home for a visit,"A home visit may be necessary shortly before discharge in order to ensure that you may return to home safely. You may request a day pass to leave the hospital to visit your family. Some insurance companies, however, do not allow day passes."
What does discharge planning mean,"Since our goal is to return patients to the community, a discharge plan is developed for every patient admitted. Discharge plans vary with individual needs. Most patients are discharged home with home care services, to a day rehabilitation program or to outpatient services. Some individuals are discharged to a long-term care facility. Your treatment will ensure that your discharge plan is well coordinated to enable you to receive appropriate follow-up care."
What kind of communication will my family and I have with my team,"Ongoing communication with your treatment team is an integral part of your rehabilitation program. Your case manager is your primary link. Each week there will be a Rehabilitation Team Review (RTR), an informational sharing session, which you are welcome to attend. If you are unable to attend, your case manager will speak with you to discuss your program. In addition, a family meeting may be scheduled soon after admission. Family meetings include your physiatrist, case manager, and other members of your treatment team."
What procedures will I have in the Emergency Department,"Treatments and procedures may include lab work, radiological studies, CAT scans, ultrasound, EKG for cardiac review, medication administration and physician evaluations"
When will I see a physician,"All patients are first triaged by an ER nurse. Then patients are evaluated by a physician. Patients who have a higher acuity of illness (i.e. heart attack or stroke) may be treated before those patients with less severe conditions (laceration, sprained ankle, etc.). Your patience is always appreciated.
"
When will I be able to eat,"Patients are able to eat after all their tests are completed and the physician has evaluated the results. On average, it is within three to four hours. However, it is sometimes necessary for patients to remain ""NPO"" (nothing by mouth) until further tests and/or studies are completed."
When will I receive my pain medication,"Because pain medication can mask important clues to your medical condition, it may not be given until tests are completed and the physician has evaluated the results. However, treatment for pain is important so please let your nurse or physician know when you are experiencing pain or if there is no relief from the medication that was prescribed. You will be asked to rate your pain throughout your stay in our department and, if admitted, on our medical floors."
How is the Emergency Department staffed,"The department is staffed with emergency medicine physicians and nurses, physician assistants, technicians, CNAs and unit coordinators along with specialists from the laboratory, cardiology, respiratory and radiology department"
Will I be allowed to have visitors during my treatment,"Yes, usually, but the number of visitors in the emergency treatment area is kept to a minimum. Occasionally, visitors will be asked to remain in the ED lobby until your loved one is placed into the room and settled into their environment. Usually, two visitors per patient are allowed in most areas of the department."
What happens if I am admitted,"Upon admission to the hospital, you will remain in the Emergency Department until your inpatient room is ready. Your admitting physician will visit you during their designated ""patient rounds."""
"Why do the members of my treatment team keep asking my name, date of birth, and/or to see my wristband","Confirming your identity is a safety precaution. Anyone providing you with medical care – for example, an IV drip or a prescription medicine – must verify your identity to make sure the right patient is receiving the appropriate care. Redundant sources of information – name, date of birth, and wristband – reduce the potential for errors. The first step toward keeping you safe is each treatment team member consistently confirming your identity."
Why does the nursing staff ask if I have to use the bathroom so often,"This is another safety precaution. Your nurses ask you about using the bathroom as a way of preventing falls. If a nurse is present, he or she can assist you in getting to and from the bathroom. Using the restroom while alone is riskier, even for patients who are normally steady on their feet. Certain medications, for example, have a side effect of dizziness, and walking normally after certain procedures can take time."
How can I best avoid falling,"Falls are a leading source of hospital injury, and Baptist Health does not want you to fall. The best way to avoid a fall is to call for assistance from a member of your treatment team whenever you need to get out of bed or move from one location to another. Wearing sensible shoes or non-slip socks is also a good idea. Of course, the risk of falling doesn’t end at the hospital"
How can I keep track of my medications,"Drug names can be long and difficult to pronounce, but the good news is that you don’t have to be a pharmacist to accurately keep track of your medications. Keep an updated list of your prescriptions, with dosages, frequencies, side effects, and your reasons for taking them. Carry the list with you, especially when seeing a doctor or another medical provider."
How can I avoid infections,"While at a Baptist Health hospital, all the usual rules about personal hygiene apply, and then some. Frequent hand washing and dressing changes are important. Urinary catheter drainage bags should be kept below hip level. Also, if you have relatives who aren’t feeling well, discourage them from visiting you until they are over their illness. If you see a treatment team member or family member not following good hygiene guidelines, please speak up. Your health is definitely worth it."
Why are members of my treatment team looking at the computer so often,"Baptist Health utilizes an electronic health record system called Epic. This system supports your care by providing and recording treatment plans, order sets, and medications. Epic also facilitates the correct treatment being provided by alerting healthcare providers to your treatment plan and changes in your condition. By making this information available to every member of your treatment team, Epic promotes patient safety. When staff members are reading or inputting information on the computer, they are ensuring you receive accurate, consistent care rooted in best practices."
Why are some patients in isolation,Patients are isolated to prevent the spread of disease to other people in the medical environment. Isolated persons are typically either highly contagious or infected by a treatment-resistant organism. Isolated person may also be those who are immunosuppressed. Medical personnel visit isolated patients regularly and wear additional protection such as gowns and gloves.
What personal information do I need to bring with me to the hospital,"Please bring the following items, as appropriate: medical insurance card, Medicare/Medicaid card, the insured’s name and Social Security Number, physician referrals (if required by your health plan), referral-order guidelines, Worker’s Compensation information, driver’s license or photo identification card, copayments or deductibles, preadmission form (if required by your health plan), and healthcare power of attorney and advance directive forms."
What safeguards are in place to perform the right surgical procedure,"To ensure patient safety during surgery, Baptist Health follows the World Health Organization’s “Surgical Safety Checklist.” The checklist applies safeguards at three points during the surgical process – prior to anesthesia, prior to incision, and prior to leaving the operating room – and involves at a minimum a nurse, the anesthesiologist, and the surgeon. Safeguards include confirming the patient’s identity, marking the surgical site when appropriate, verifying technologies and medications, identifying allergies, counting surgical tools before closure, and addressing post-surgical treatment needs."
How can I know I am getting the right medications,"Always ask your treatment team members if you have any questions or concerns about your medications. To practice safe medication protocol from the beginning of your visit, provide your team with an accurate list of your medications and their dosages. Equally important is providing them with feedback on how any new medications make you feel once you begin taking them. Drugs can have different effects on different people, and sometimes adjustments in dosage, frequency, or the medicine itself are required to achieve the best results."
How do I advocate for my loved one,"To be a strong advocate, you must be knowledgeable about your loved one’s needs and willing to speak up on his or her behalf. At Baptist, we encourage you to broach sensitive topics and address your questions and concerns with members of the treatment team. Your voice is incredibly important to us."
What do I need to tell the members of my treatment team,"You should tell them anything you think is relevant to your care. They need to know how you’re feeling, and how that changes from day to day. They need to know your medical history, your family’s medical history, your current prescriptions, and any allergies. They need to know how you react to the medications and treatments you receive. Finally, please share your anxieties and concerns, so that they can play a positive role in helping you deal with them. Remember: Your voice is the most important one on the team."
I'm not sure I know what is the best protection against the omicron variant,"The CDC says that omicron is now the most common variant among new Covid cases in the U.S., accounting for nearly three-quarters of new infections. The easiest and safest way to protect yourself against the omicron variant is to get vaccinated"
"Do I still have to wear a mask, even when it is not required by a business"," Masking has been a strong defense against the Delta virus, and continues to be for the more contagious omicron strain, especially indoors or in public spaces. Universal masking is recommended to slow the spread of COVID-19. Cloth face masks won’t fully protect you against the COVID-19 omicron variant. Health experts are urging the public to opt for three-ply surgical masks, KN95 or N95 masks which offer more protection against the highly contagious variant. Please note that mask mandates continue to be in full effect for local and federal public transportation systems, including travel by airplane and trains per federal mandate."
I'm pregnant (or want to become pregnant soon),"Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 vaccinations cause issues with pregnancy or being able to get pregnant in the future."
I've already had COVID-19.,"Even if you have already recovered from COVID-19, it is possible—although rare—that you could be infected with the virus that causes COVID-19 again. The vaccine can protect you from severe illness and death. We don't know how long someone is protected from getting sick again after recovering from COVID-19."
I have a preexisting condition.,The vaccine was studied in people with many different preexisting and chronic conditions and has been proven to be safe. Your doctor is the best person to talk to about your specific health situation.
I'm concerned about long-term side effects,"There are two types of COVID-19 vaccines — mRNA and viral vector vaccines — and medical experts have been studying and working on both types for decades. The COVID-19 vaccine was created using these long-standing vaccine building blocks. The COVID-19 vaccines went through all required stages of approval, and clinicians continue to track any potential side effects. In fact, the COVID-19 vaccines are currently undergoing the most intensive safety monitoring in U.S. history."
I'm not sure if the vaccine was researched with me in mind,"The clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine included a more diverse group of subjects than previous trials for other drugs and vaccines. The population studied closely mirrored ethnic groups in the U.S. population. The trials also studied the vaccine's effect in people with certain chronic conditions, including diabetes and heart disease."
I feel like the vaccine was rushed to market,"The COVID-19 vaccines were created in record time — but this doesn't mean the process was rushed. There are several reasons why companies were able to produce the vaccines faster than normal, including a head start from previous research on other coronaviruses, decades of vaccine research, collaboration within the scientific community and expedited review."
I want to wait until the FDA approves the vaccine,"""Emergency Use Authorization"" means that manufacturing and administration were expedited, not that a different approval or safety process applies. All typical steps in the approval process were followed, especially as it pertains to the evaluation of efficacy and safety."
I can't afford to wait hours to get the vaccine or to pay for it.,"There is more than enough supply, and appointments are available — often within a 5-minute drive from your house. The vaccine is free, even if you don't have insurance, and you don't need to bring a photo ID. Use the vaccine finder below to find a site convenient for you.
"
I don’t understand why boosters are needed,"FDA authorized for adults age 65 and older, adults at high-risk for severe COVID-19, and adults with frequent occupational or institutional exposure to the SARS-CoV-2 virus a single booster dose of the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine at least six months after completing a primary dose series. It also authorized adults who received a single dose of the J&J vaccine to receive a booster dose at least two months later; FDA clarified that adults under age 65 who have frequent institutional or occupational exposure to SARS-CoV-2 may receive a Pfizer booster."
"If I need medical attention but cannot afford it, what can I do","No one is turned away from HCGH needing emergent/emergency care because of inability to pay. We direct patients to the Financial Counselors located in the Admitting Department who will work with you to develop a payment plan, help you apply for Medical Assistance or, if you qualify, arrange for free care."
Where can I donate blood,Call the local American Red Cross at 1-800-452-5663 to arrange for such a donation. Any donations can be designated for you or for the Hospital at the time of giving.
Can I fill out any required paperwork before I get there,Yes. To view all hospital forms that are available on this web site that may be printed and completed in advance of your visit
May I take flowers or gifts to a patient at HCGH,Gifts are allowed on all units. Flowers are allowed on all units except the Intensive Care Unit.
How does my insurance company receive the claims for healthcare services,"At the time of your pre-registration or admission, we'll verify your insurance coverage and benefits as well as obtain authorizations, if required. Depending on the nature of your visit and your insurance coverage, you may be asked to pay a deposit, copayment or deductible at the time of service."
What does my insurance cover,"If you have questions about what's covered under your healthcare policy, please talk to your insurance provider. Although we do our best to assist you with coverage questions, it's your responsibility to know what your plan covers."
What if I don't have insurance,"If you don't have insurance, call 650-988-8275 to talk to one of our financial counselors and learn more about payment options, including financial assistance."
When do I make the copayment or deductible payment,"Copayments, which are fixed dollar amounts determined by your insurance company, are due at the time of service. If you're unsure of your copay responsibility, please contact your insurance provider for coverage and copayment details.

Before you're admitted to El Camino Hospital, our financial counselors will obtain your deductible information when they check your eligibility."
How do I make a payment,"You can pay your bill online, by mail or by phone."
What if I don't pay my bill,"If we don't receive payment in full or a mutually agreed upon payment arrangement isn't obtained in a timely manner, your account may be referred to an outside collection agency. We encourage you to call us immediately to prevent your account from becoming delinquent."
"If I'm unable to make the full payment, can I set up a payment plan",Yes. Our customer service staff can set up a payment plan based on our established policies.
Will I receive a bill,"If a balance remains after your claim has been processed by your insurance, you'll receive a billing statement. You will also receive a billing statement from us if your insurance doesn't pay your claim."
What forms of payment are accepted,"We accept credit cards — American Express, Discover, MasterCard and Visa — debit cards, personal checks and money orders."
